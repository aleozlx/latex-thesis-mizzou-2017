Original Readme

Look through each .tex file for explanation of what to fill in each.

After you have edited all of the .tex files, here's how you compile the .pdf:
 1) run latex or pdftex on ThesisMaster.tex (it will call on the other .tex files automatically)
 2) run bibtex on your .bib file
 3) run latex or pdftex on ThesisMaster.tex again (perhaps several times until number of warnings stops changing)
